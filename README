OpenAttribute for Chrome
=========================

OpenAttribute for Chrome adds support for displaying license and
attribution information for works as you browse. If the page or items
on the page are licensed, a CC icon will appear in the URL bar, which
can be clicked to display the author and license information. This
metadata is used to generate HTML which can be used to attribute
reuse.
